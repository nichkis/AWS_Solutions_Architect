# S3 Notes

* spread across multiple devices & facilities

* 0B to 5TB file size, unlimited storage

* **universal namespace:** bucket names must be unique globally

  - *https://\<bucket_name\>.s3.amazonaws.com*
  - *https://\<bucket_name\>.\<region\>.amazonaws.com*


* 200 response code on successful upload

* **Object-based:**

  - *Key*
  - *Value* (data as sequence of bytes)
  - *VersionID*
  - *Metadata*
  - *Subresources* e.g. ACL, Torrent


* **Data Consistency:**

  - Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  - Eventual consistency for overwrite of PUTS & DELETES (needs to propagate)


* **Guarantees:**

  - 99.99% availability
  - 99.99999999999% (11 9's after decimal) durability


* **Features:**

  1. Tiered storage available
  2. Lifecycle Management
  3. Versioning
  4. Encryption
  5. MFA (multi-factor authentication) delete
  6. Secure data with ACL & Bucket Policies


* **Storage Classes:**

  - Standard: designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently
  - Infrequently Accessed (IA): charged retrieval fee
  - One Zone IA
  - Intelligent Tiering: uses ML to cost optimize
  - Glacier: configurable retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours
  - Glacier Deep Archive: 12 hour retrieval times


* **Charges:**

  - Storage (size in bytes)
  - Requests (accessing data)
  - Storage Management (see *Storage Classes*)
  - Data Transfer
  - Transfer Acceleration
